## Description 

**toDo is a to-do application built with React and MockAPI.** This project was created for both learning React and for the [Popupsmart React Practicum](https://www.patika.dev/bootcamp/popupsmart-react-practicum), which was created with Patika.dev and Popupsmart.

The API endpoint of the project is provided with MockAPI. The following is a diagram of the API endpoint. The to-do list was created, updated, deleted, and listed using this endpoint. Each user's to-do list is saved under their own API endpoint, and the name information obtained from the user is saved in local storage.
